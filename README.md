# AndJoin - make each team member able to develop Android tests
======
AndJoin is an automate test framework designed for android App testing in middle-sized agile teams. 
It eases test creation and maintenance and able to Join everyone into Android test development -- that's where the name comes from.

##What you can get from AndJoin?
1. quick runnable testcases to cover your smoke test
2. test logic in natural language
3. flexible testcases to maintain
4. extensible modules to add new test functions
5. scalable architecture to accommadate compatibility test on devices across multiple make/models

##System Support and Requirement

AndJoin is verified on Ubuntu LTS 12.04 and 14.04. I don't have an exact plan to support Windows yet but already took some actions for the adaptive purpose.

AndJoin uses [AndroidViewClient](https://github.com/dtmilano/AndroidViewClient) developed by Diego Torres Milano to control the Android devices under test.
